   - Students see only exams for their semester + department
   - Example: Semester 1 CS students only see Semester 1 CS exams

4. **Enum Handling**
   - Fixed ExamStatus enum comparisons
   - Added safe enum value extraction

## 📋 Current Status

### Working ✅
- Backend API endpoints

- Subject loading in enrollment form
- Professional UI design

### Needs Debugging 🔍
- Notifications endpoint returning empty array
- Need to verify enum filtering
- Backend server needs restart to load changes

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Restart Backend Server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Test Complete Flow**
   - Admin creates exam event
   - Student sees notification
   - Student applies with subject selection
   - Admin reviews and approves
   - Student sees approved status

3. **Verify Database**
   - Check exam_events table
   - Check exam_schedules table
   - Check student_enrollment_applications table
