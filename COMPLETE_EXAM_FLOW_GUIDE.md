```

## 🎯 **Step 4: Generate Final Results**

After entering marks for all 3 events, go to **Results tab**:

### **A. Calculate Subject Results**

Click **"Calculate All Subject Results"**

This will:
1. **Aggregate marks** for each student-subject combination:
   ```
   Student: SCOE1011, Subject: CS201
   - IA: 20/25
   - Oral: 20/25
   - ESE: 40/50
   - Total: 80/100
   ```

2. **Calculate grade** using Mumbai University scale:
   ```
   80/100 = 80% = A grade (9 grade points)
   ```

3. **Determine pass/fail**:
   - Must pass each component (IA ≥ 10, Oral ≥ 10, ESE ≥ 20)
   - Must get overall ≥ 40/100

4. **Save to `subject_final_results` table**:
   ```
   - student_id: 1
   - subject_id: 201
   - total_marks: 80
   - grade: A
   - grade_points: 9
   - is_pass: true
   - ia_marks: 20
   - oral_marks: 20
   - ese_marks: 40
   ```

---

### **B. Calculate SGPA/CGPA**

Click **"Calculate All SGPA/CGPA"**

This will:
1. **Calculate SGPA** for each student:
   ```
   SGPA = Σ(credits × grade_points) / Σ(credits)
   
   Example for SCOE1011:
   CS201: 4 credits × 9 points = 36
   CS204: 3 credits × 9 points = 27
   CS205: 3 credits × 8 points = 24
   Total: 87 points / 10 credits = 8.7 SGPA
   ```

2. **Determine result class**:
   - SGPA ≥ 7.5 = First Class with Distinction
   - SGPA ≥ 6.0 = First Class
   - SGPA ≥ 5.0 = Second Class
   - SGPA ≥ 4.0 = Pass Class
   - SGPA < 4.0 = Fail

3. **Calculate CGPA** (if previous semesters exist):
   ```
   CGPA = Average of all semester SGPAs
   ```

4. **Determine overall status**:
   - ✅ **Successful** - All subjects passed
   - ❌ **Unsuccessful** - One or more subjects failed (ATKT/Backlog)

5. **Save to `semester_results` table**:
   ```
   - student_id: 1
   - semester: 2
   - sgpa: 8.7
   - cgpa: 8.5
   - total_credits: 10
   - credits_earned: 10
   - result_status: PASS
   - result_class: First Class with Distinction
   ```

## 📊 **Final Results Display**

The Results tab will show a table with:

| Roll No | Student Name | Subjects Passed | Subjects Failed | Credits | SGPA | CGPA | Status | Class |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|------|------|--------|-------|
| SCOE1011 | Varun Mehta | 5/5 | 0 | 10 | 8.7 | 8.5 | ✅ Pass | First Class with Distinction |
| SCOE1013 | Aryan Verma | 4/5 | 1 | 8 | 6.2 | 6.0 | ❌ ATKT | First Class |
